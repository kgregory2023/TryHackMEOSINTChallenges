Type: Cybersecurity Challenge (Open-Source Intelligence)
Tools Used: ExifTool, Google Dorking, Social Media Analysis, GitHub, WordPress, Online Geolocation tools

Objective:
To perform an OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigation on a fictional target by collecting and analyzing publicly available information to piece together a digital footprint. The goal was to identify personal details, location, social media handles, Wi-Fi details, and project affiliations.

Process & Findings:
Metadata Extraction (ExifTool):

Analyzed the provided image WindowsXP.jpg using exiftool.

Extracted GPS coordinates embedded in the image metadata:

Latitude: 54°17'41.27"N

Longitude: 2°15'1.33"W

Location Analysis:

Entered GPS data into mapping tools to triangulate the approximate location of the target in the UK.

Social Media OSINT:

Discovered the Twitter handle @OWoodflint from metadata clues.

Reviewed the Twitter feed to find a BSSID (B4:5D:50:AA:86:41) and a reference to free Wi-Fi.

Blog & Online Presence:

Located a WordPress blog authored by owoodflint.

Blog stated the author was in New York at the time of posting.

Used developer tools to uncover hidden text in HTML: “pennYDr0pper.1” – possibly a password or alias.

GitHub Enumeration:

Found the GitHub repository OWoodfl1nt/people_finder.

Identified full name as Oliver Woodflint, interests, and another email: OWoodflint@gmail.com.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
Metadata forensics (ExifTool)

Social media enumeration

Use of developer tools to analyze hidden site content

Correlation of usernames and digital identities across platforms

Critical thinking and chain-of-evidence correlation in OSINT

Outcome:
Successfully built a comprehensive profile on the target using only publicly available information. This lab reinforces core OSINT principles used in cyber threat intelligence, red teaming, and digital forensics.
